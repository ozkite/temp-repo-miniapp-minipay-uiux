    "Project Name":"Bees and Trees: Restoring Land through Agroforestry in Uganda",
    "Description":"Bees and Trees motivates smallholder farmers in Uganda to restore degraded land through incentives. They gift beehives and coffee seedlings to farmers. This motivates the farmers to plant coffee shade trees and bee forage species, integrating trees into their farms. So far, 734 trees have been planted and marked on the GainForest Green Globe. The trees contribute to land and habitat restoration, mitigate climate change and prevent landslides. At the same time honey and coffee sales provide additional income to the farmers; while the bees enhance food production and biodiversity through pollination.The social enterprise also purchases coffee grown under agroforestry at premium prices, further motivating farmers to integrate and preserve trees on their farms.",

The situation has particularly impacted their children, who must endure a six-hour walk under the scorching sun to reach school. In response, Gainforest and Oya Institute have partnered with the community to launch a fundraising campaign aimed at constructing an artesian well and purchasing a quad bike. These solutions would provide reliable access to clean water and safer transportation, helping the community maintain their traditional way of life while building resilience against the increasing challenges of climate change. The campaign seeks donations and social sharing to support these vital infrastructure improvements that would significantly impact the daily lives of community members.",

Oceanus trained 11 local surveyors to use smartphones for data collection, replacing traditional pen-and-paper methods. Combining their local knowledge with technology, the surveyors documented 600 mangrove trees, recording species, diameter at breast height (DBH), height, GPS coordinates, and photos of tree barks, leaves, flowers, and fruits. These parameters are key in determining the carbon potential of each tree. The surveyors collectively earned 40 pesos per tree, providing a form of supplemental livelihood. A total of 48,000 pesos was distributed through two wallet accounts managed by field officers, who facilitated cash withdrawals and ensured transparent payment distribution. By integrating local expertise with technology, the project provided exposure to digital tools and actively involved communities in mangrove conservation efforts.",

Prior to project implementation, a feasibility assessment was conducted to ensure ecological suitability and community readiness. This included measuring diameter at breast height (DBH), canopy height, and community structure; monitoring water levels; interviewing community members; documenting past planting projects; and checking the current status of existing mangroves. The community took geotagged photos using smartphones to support data collection. Abandoned and active fishponds were delineated using Google Earth Engine and later validated on the ground. Your support will help scale this science-backed, community-driven approach to safeguard the coast and strengthen the resilience of communities in Camarines Norte, which faces frequent typhoons and is highly vulnerable to storm surges.",

It aims to instill environmental stewardship in children while promoting agroforestry practices among farmers to enhance food security, biodiversity, and climate resilience. By integrating trees with food crops, the project contributes to carbon sequestration, soil restoration, and sustainable livelihoods. In the past one year, we have been able to train more than 300 learners on planting and taking care of trees. Each has adopted 2 trees. This has enabled us to plant more than 700 trees in  diferent sites. We are moving to integrating this with agroforestry so as to include the communitues around the schools in planting trees together with their crops, this will lead to increased food security, soil restoration and sustainable livelihoods. Your donation to the Adopt a Tree project supports climate action, environmental education, food security, and community resilience\u2014all in one initiative.

Prompted by inadequate infrastructure, limited healthcare, environmental degradation, and the aftermath of a 2017 fire, the campaign adopts a multi-faceted approach with active participation from local leaders and residents. Spearheaded by the Green Ambassadors Club and other partners, the initiative prioritizes youth empowerment through skill development to enhance livelihoods and healthcare access. Key focus areas include environmental conservation and sustainable livelihoods, with youth training in soap making and crafting reusable sanitary towels to reduce reliance on the mainland and create local jobs. Healthcare improvement involves installing a solar-powered system at the clinic for proper medicine storage, advocating for a stationed nurse, and organizing medical camps, one recently serving 1,500 residents. The campaign also focuses on renewable energy and clean lighting by distributing solar lamps to students and families, and on hygiene and sanitation through the construction of additional restrooms near schools and the clinic.\nThe campaign has already achieved tangible impact by training 500 youth and single mothers in skills like soap and Vaseline making and providing food and clothing to vulnerable families. By emphasizing local ownership and capacity building, the Kimi Restoration Campaign is committed to fostering a healthier, more self-reliant, and environmentally conscious community.",

Around 60 families participate in local Mweria group, rotating labor associations where members support one another in home repairs, gardening, infrastructure building, and community care. These groups embody long-standing traditions of mutual aid, where commitments are tracked through trust, memory, and shared intention.\nAt the center of this effort is the Friends of Kiriba Ecosystem Pool, a collective that curates and supports these groups using the Commitment Pooling Protocol\u2014a framework inspired by natural systems like mycorrhizal fungi and traditional social coordination practices. This protocol guides the community\u2019s coordination through four core functions: Curation, Valuation, Limitation, and Exchange. Using the Sarafu Network, a blockchain-based platform developed by Grassroots Economics, community members express and exchange commitments. Each collective action\u2014whether planting food forests, building water features, or restoring sacred forests\u2014is tracked and honored. Stewardship certificates validate these acts, turning them into assets for the commons.\nKiriba is becoming a living laboratory for regenerative practices\u2014reviving degraded land, strengthening social bonds, and modeling a new kind of economy rooted in trust, reciprocity and care. It's not just about restoring ecosystems, but also relationships\u2014with the land, each other, and tradition.

This motivates the farmers to plant coffee shade trees and bee forage species that Bees & Trees provides, hence integrating trees into their farms. This year, 1,066 trees have been planted and marked on the GainForest Green Globe. The trees contribute to land and habitat restoration, mitigate climate change and prevent landslides. At the same time, honey and coffee sales provide additional income to the farmers; while the bees enhance food production and biodiversity through pollination. The social enterprise also purchases coffee grown under agroforestry at premium prices, further motivating farmers to integrate and preserve trees on their farms.",
